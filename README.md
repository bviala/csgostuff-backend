# CSGOStuff

CSGOStuff is a personal project I made on spring 2018 to learn Node, Vue, and GraphQL.
The application displays a scrollable and sortable list of GIFs showing Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) stuffs. In this game, a "stuff" refers to a smoke, incendiary or flash grenade thrown in a particular place to gain a tactical advantage on the opponent.

This project features:
- A Vue.js SPA with Vuetify.js as UI framework (csgostuff-frontend repo)
- A GraphQL API built with Node.js (csgostuff-backend repo)
- Google Sign-In implementation
- A voting system for connected users
- A form for connected users to submit new stuffs, with field validation
- Stuff sorting based on their score
- Stuff filtering
- Infinite scrolling

[Live demo here.](https://kindhearted-battle.surge.sh/#/) The backend uses a free hosting that goes idle when not used, so content will probably take time to load on your first visit.

- Unfortunately not responsive. Will look terrible on mobile.
